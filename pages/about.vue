          <p class="text-lg">What can I do?</p>
          <p>I work with all things related to websites and web development. To me, websites arenâ€™t just a nice
            interface for information, a website can be so much more.</p>
          <p>It is a piece of interactive art, you can make it bend and twirl as you want and it all comes together as
            something useful. </p>
          <p>I create digital art, I very much enjoy the beauty in chaos, dystpoianism, brutalism, all things grunge
            and out of line. </p>
          <p>I also play the guitar and write music.</p>
